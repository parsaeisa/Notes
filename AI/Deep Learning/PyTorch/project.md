# Project Overview

This is the life cycle of a real project : 
* Define parameters
* Load dataset 
* Define an explorer to extract the policy .
* Policy
* Training
    - explorer
    - bunch of epochs to iterate 

Q-function is a dictionary . 

there is a fit and a learn . what's the difference ?? 

We always need a plotter method . Like loggers in a backend project .
