# GenAI

GenAI stands for Generative AI. It is the group of AI applications which generate texts and media (photo and audio). These applications try to resemble the training data. 

**Transformer architecture** is now the backbone of GenAI applications.

For making our own models, there are two names:
- RAG: Which relates to giving updated resources to LLM such as our database and web search
- Fine tuning: Which is training the application based on **domain-specific** data. In opposite to Fine-tuned network we have pre-tuned network. Pre-tuned network is a network trained on generic data.
