# VHDL

## Structure
Structure of a code has 3 parts : 
* Library imports
* Ports' definitions
* Logiss definition

## Architecture definition
There are 3 ways to do this : 
* Behavioral
* Dataflow (RTL)
* Structural

#### Behavioral
It only contains arithmetic logics .

#### Dataflow (RTL)
It describes the way that data flows in . 

#### Structural
It describes the circuit as a bunch of components and their connections .

It has something called **Hierarchicall design** which has **top-modules** and **sub-modules** . 

## Words 

`signal`
