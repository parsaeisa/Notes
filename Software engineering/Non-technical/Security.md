# Security

## Mindset

We have a mturity level of software engineers in context of secure softwqare engineering:

- Denial: I don't have to think about it.
- Irrational fear: No, we can't do anything, in today's world everything is possible. Full of negativity.
- Bag of tricks: We have implemented 10 tricks. Is it enough? Are we close?
- Mature: A meture software engineer has a **reasoned, balanced and defensive** mindset.

We have two concepts about use cases which are:
- Misuse: Intentionally
- Abuse

**Both** can do harm.

## OWASP
 
One of the first names which come to mind in context of security is OWASP. 

I think it provides a report every year about more dangerous vulnerabilities.
