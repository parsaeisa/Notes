# Engineering Management (by Reforge)

## Terminology

- IC: this is developer

## Mindset

There are two types of mindset in each work:
- Reactive
- Strategic

Downsides of reactive mindset: To complete

* EMs are not supposed to answer to everyone's priorities. The EM must choose which priority to answer. 



### Core objectives for EMs

Guarantee the **impactful** & **reliabe** output as agreed. 

## Production cycle

1- Work intake
2- Assign tasks to IC's
3- Tracking with **Agile methods**
4- Sign-off and delivery
5- Retrospectives

This is good to engage IC's in each of these steps.
