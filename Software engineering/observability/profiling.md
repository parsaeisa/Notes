# Profiling

Profiling is the process of analyzing the performance characteristics of a software program or system. It involves measuring various metrics, such as CPU usage, memory consumption, execution time, and function/method call frequencies, to identify performance bottlenecks or areas of improvement. Profiling helps developers optimize their code and improve the overall performance of an application.
