# Observability

There are 4 main terms in observability : 
* Logging
* Monitoring
* Profiling
* Tracing 

For a long time I thaught that Monitoring and Profiling are same things. But they are different. Monitoring is about the application performance and profiling is about the resources that an application consumes.

## Questions

Is Health check something different from monitoring ? Isn't one of them a subset of the other ?
