# DBA

What are DBA's duties ??

## Database access

There is a rule called **Least Privilege Principle** which tells to give users the least access possible.

## Proxysql

I think proxysql is a proxy server that filters different sql commands. For example aggregation functions are very expensive on large tables. So, they can reject queries with aggregation function. 

## Archiving

Some old data may be very expensive to retrieve. So they may have solutions for retrieving old data.
