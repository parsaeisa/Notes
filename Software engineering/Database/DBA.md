# DBA

What are DBA's duties ??

## Proxysql

I think proxysql is a proxy server that filters different sql commands. For example aggregation functions are very expensive on large tables. So, they can reject queries with aggregation function. 

## Archiving

Some old data may be very expensive to retrieve. So they may have solutions for retrieving old data.
