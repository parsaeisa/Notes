# Fuzzy logic

I guess fuzzy logic is a logic that the factor of your program's judgement are not numbers, but descriptive terms. 

**Membership functions** is a concept in fuzzy logic. 

Example: Suppose you have two products and you want to sort them by the user's rate. What do you do? Keep in mind that a product with rate 4.4 from 10000 users may be better than a product with rate 5 from 10 users.

Rate 5 from 10 users is very faudulent.
