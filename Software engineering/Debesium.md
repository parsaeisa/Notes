# Debesium

Debesium is a open source platform that captures changes in database. 

When you insert, update or delete a row in your app's database, Debesium will publish an event over [Apache Kafka](https://github.com/parsaeisa/Notes/blob/main/Software%20engineering/Brokers/Kafka.md).

Using Debesium there is no need to publish events in your app and change your app's structure.
