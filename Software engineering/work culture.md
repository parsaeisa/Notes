# Work culture 

As a software engineer what should I think about ? 

## Coding

- Reading the code of a new project is a skill that you should have. --> You should understand it's layers and go from top (the interface layer) to the bottom. 
    - Read different projects in the firm. You can see their tricks & best practices. 

- Very obvious but critical point: more than 95 percent of issues come from the code itself. Even the deployments. Before asking Ahmad check the code carefully. 

- Before the solution design session for a new feature try to find out how it should be implemented.

## Mindset

- Try to undertand & **remember** events. Events like :
    - starting a project
    - Leaving a project undone
    - Someone being upset
    - What is happening in the whole ? 

- Try to give solutions all the time. (the solution can go beyond software engineering and go to other parts 
like QA, product, analyze, etc.)
    - You can also correct your manager, for example while breaking a task ( tasks' granularity)

- Prioritize your tasks. don't work on more than one task at a time. (You can lower the time interval of working on different tasks to ** **)
