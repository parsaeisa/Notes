# Work culture 

As a software engineer what should I think about ? 

Give comments on product flows, think about them and try to find holes in it and make it better. 

## Coding

- Reading the code of a new project is a skill that you should have. --> You should understand it's layers and go from top (the interface layer) to the bottom. There some sources that you can read:
    * Read different projects in the firm. You can see their tricks & best practices. 
    * When you are working with a tool (like sqlx), read it's structure using command click.
    * Other resource is github starred projects by your friends.

- Very obvious but critical point: more than 95 percent of issues come from the code itself. Even the deployments. Before asking Ahmad check the code carefully. 

- Before the solution design session for a new feature try to find out how it should be implemented.

### Expectations 

#### Junior level
A junior developer is expected to know where each functionality is placed in the project code base.

So, if a bug happens on a project, he/she should find it immediately and fix it.  A juior developer should be dominant on **Business logic**.

> A tip: for finding different functionalities in code base, only remember the project's connection to outside world ( http handlers, cmq handler, etc.) and start traversing from there. 

A junior should have **search and documents reading skills**.

A junior must be able to work with different tools (such as redis, rabbit, etc.) , to work with their dashboard or their cli or other things.

* As an example, sometimes there is a need to delete messages on a broker manually.

While **Searching**, when you open a link, read it completely or read it until you see that it's useless. then open new tabs and documents. **Don't open** too many tabs. 

> You always think about searching too late. Start it sooner.

A junior developer must always **consider team trends**. Try to follow, undertand & **remember** events. Events like :
    - starting a project
    - Leaving a project undone
    - Someone being upset
    - What is happening in the whole (technical and business logic) ? 
    - A logic's improvements and problems

> Always check your email and important group chats.

> Don't do anything in sessions. Just listen.

#### Mid-level

These are duties that I see our mid-levels have:
- Design, generally thinking about what to do ??
- Starting new projects

#### Attitude

Always attitude like you are **Badass** and **Cool**. Never show yourself weak. 

If a bug is raised to your projects, say "I need time to work on this bug" and do not show yourself Natch.

## Mindset

- Try to give solutions all the time. (the solution can go beyond software engineering and go to other parts 
like QA, product, analyze, etc.)
    - You can also correct your manager, for example while breaking a task ( tasks' granularity)

- Prioritize your tasks. don't work on more than one task at a time. (You can lower the time interval of working on different tasks to ** **)

### Teamwork mindset

The atomicity in a software company is **team** not **person**. 

If you have a solution that you strongly think that is correct, it is not necessarily applied if other team members are not agree with it. (Even don't insist too much).

If a facinating task must be delivered in the team, your concern should be meeting the deadline of that task regardless to it's assigned developer. (Personnaly I always wanted to do facinating tasks myself, this concern is wrong)

Even If you have enough tasks and you do not have free time, feel free to reject a new task that arrives.
