# Estimation

A software engineer must be able to etimate the resource needed for a backend service.

Of course the resources are:
- Ram
- Hard disk

At first try to find factors, then go to precise numbers.

Important factors:
- Number of users
- Number of active users
- Peak times
- Number of requests
- Number of data records
- etc ...

Apparently, this estimation doesn't have a defined rule and it is more experimental. 

- IO boundity
- CPU boundity
- Throttling
