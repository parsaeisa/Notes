# Brokers

Brokers are a way for communicating between microservices. A third party server that takes the responsibility of recieveing and publishing ( and in cases storing ) the messages . 

I think all of them use MQTT protocol . 

* MQTT protocol is so neat in IoT .

Famous brokers : 
* Kafka
* Rabbit mq
* MQTT
* Nats ( and nats streaming and jetstream and etc)
