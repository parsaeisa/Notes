# Blockchain 

Each block in a chain contains a transaction in computer's network that **cannot be altered**. 

Blockchain programming is used to build a wide range of applications.

Blockchain applications can be used for smart contracts.

* Decentralization : It's somehow like p2p network. 

## Platforms

These are programming platforms. 

* Etherium: For support of smart contracts. **Supported languages**: Solidity
* Hyperledger Fabric and Corda : For enterprice applications. **Supported languages**: Go, Rust or java

**Ethereum:** Ethereum is one of the most well-known platforms for building decentralized applications and smart contracts. The primary language for writing smart contracts on Ethereum is Solidity. Solidity is a high-level, statically-typed language designed specifically for Ethereum's Virtual Machine (EVM).

**Bitcoin:** While Bitcoin's scripting language is not as versatile as some other platforms, developers can write custom transactions using Bitcoin Script. Bitcoin Script is a simple, stack-based language that allows for basic conditions and operations within Bitcoin transactions.

**Hyperledger Fabric:** Hyperledger Fabric is an open-source platform for developing private, permissioned blockchain networks. Chaincode (smart contracts) on Fabric can be written in multiple programming languages such as Go, JavaScript (Node.js), and Java.

**EOSIO:** EOSIO is designed for decentralized applications and smart contracts. Smart contracts on EOSIO are written in C++. The EOSIO platform emphasizes scalability and performance.

**Cardano:** Cardano is a blockchain platform that aims to provide a more secure and scalable infrastructure. Smart contracts on Cardano can be written in Plutus, which is based on Haskell programming language.

**Tezos**: Tezos is a blockchain platform that supports self-amendment and on-chain governance. Smart contracts on Tezos are written in Michelson, a stack-based language designed to be verifiable and secure.

**Ripple:** Ripple uses a consensus algorithm different from typical blockchains, and its scripting language is RippleScript, which is a higher-level language for defining payment and currency exchange operations.

**Corda:** Corda is a blockchain platform designed for businesses. It supports writing smart contracts in various languages including Java and Kotlin.

## Wallets 

Wallets has API's that developer can use to require user's interactions. 

## DApps 

Many applications with various purposes can be relied on blockchain mindset. 

## Consensus Mechanisms

* **PoW** requires miners to solve complex mathematical problems to validate transactions.
* **PoS** validators are chosen based on the number of tokens they hold and are willing to "stake" as collateral
