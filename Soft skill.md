# Soft skill

Soft skill comes up the most in people management positions such engineering managing. 

Here are some scattered points from [this paper](https://dev.jimgrey.net/2024/07/03/lessons-learned-in-35-years-of-making-software/):
- Look for most straightforward way. Don't wait for that clever solution. 
- Relationships matters. Get back to your "Social" docuemtn on google drive. be helpful to others. 
- Build good relationships with your higher ups. 
- Do not work in **silence**.
- Build a network of people in your field, outside the company. 
- Be willing: When you are asked to do something that you don't know anything about, simply say "I'd figure it out"
- If a task went as perfect as you wanted, you probably spent **too much time** on that task. It means that perfctionism is not a good thing. If you reach about 60-80% of what you wanted, that's probably enough. 
- Chase adventure not the salary. Let's accept this fact that even in lowest level in our career, the payment is good, so we should think about adventure not **promotions**. 

Some of my experiences:
- Don't of work on a task alone. Try to keep your manager update about the task progress and ask help when it's needed ( more accurately, get help when you think there is someone in **your team** who can reach the answer more quickly)
